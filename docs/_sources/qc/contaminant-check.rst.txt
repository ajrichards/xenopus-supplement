Contaminant check
=======================

The following plots indicate the proportion of reads mapping to each of the categories listed. Unless a sample is closely related to one of the categories, you should not expect to see significant numbers of reads mapping to any of these categories.  For transcriptomics experiments, signficant rRNA may be present if rRNA depletion was performed or if there is evidence of RNA degredation during Bioanalyser checks.  Significant quantities of adaptor sequence are indicative of short fragment sizes or issues relating to DNA quantification.
